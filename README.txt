## What's next for Health on Track
- Uses a calendar and notification system to remind users of _which_ medications they need to take and _when_ they need to take them.
- Allows organizers to make forms so users can track their own symptoms.
- Makes contact easy between participants and hosts of the trial (a messaging system of sorts).
- Details information of how and where the user can get their medication (address of where it's delivered to, such as a pharmacy, testing center, home, etc.). Authors can choose whether users can edit that info or if it has to stay they same.
